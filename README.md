# Deep Learning in Computational Mechanics: An Introductory Course (supplementary material)
- This [repository](https://github.com/cmpmech/deep-learning-in-computational-mechanics) contains the supplementary material of the textbook:

***[Deep Learning in Computational Mechanics: An Introductory Course](https://link.springer.com/book/9783031895289)*** (Second Edition), *Leon Herrmann, Moritz Jokeit, Oliver Weeger, and Stefan Kollmannsberger*, Springer 2025, ISBN: TBD, URL: TBD

- The material consists of exercises (as Jupyter notebooks and Python files) described in the book (**exercises**), short demos (as Jupyter notebooks) covered in the book (**demos**), and lecture slides (as PowerPoint and pdf files) (**slides**). 

## Installation
1) Download the repository - either with `git clone` or the "Download ZIP" button online
2) from the command line, enter that directory with `cd exercises`
3) run: `conda env create -f environment.yml` 
    this will create a new environment named `aicome`
4) activate with `conda activate aicome`

### Quickstart
1) Start jupyter from the command line with: `jupyter lab`
2) Open a demo .ipynb file and confirm that running it successfully imports packages like `torch` and cells below run successfully. If so, your environment is ready for all the exercises in the book!
